Task1(This task made by myself(Asilbek Muhammadiyev))
this task required some research on how to use the function which works with double star symbol “**”, preceding an argument. However it was done quite normal and tested the result sucessfully. 

Task2(This task made by myself(Asilbek Muhammadiyev))
It was confusing, especially the dictionay part, it really required some time to understand the context. However the best part was to work with built-in function that is used to check the data types. 

Task3(This task made by Hasan Saydazimov)
