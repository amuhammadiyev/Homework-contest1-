Task1 required some research on how to use the function which works with double star symbol “**”, preceding an argument. However it was done quite normal and tested the result sucessfully. 

Task2 was confusing, especially the dictionay part, it really required some time to understand the context. However the best part was to work with built-in function that is used to check the data types. isinstance was used for the case of integer and float types so that we could check for both data types in one raw.
